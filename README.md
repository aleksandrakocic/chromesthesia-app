# chromesthesia-app
Technical part for the Major Project
The application is run by opening the live server from the text editor.
The app folder contains the main page and two folders for the cs and js.
Used HTML, CSS and JS + Bootstrap and Tone.js library. 
For the full application performance it is necessary to turn on the sound on the computer. The piano is played by the keypress of the marked letters, each corresponding for one piano key. The element of the piano that is represented in the application is the C major scale.  In additions to the piano there is a colors animation which is the visual animation of the sound based on its pitch and duration. It is possible to turn the animation on/off by toggle switch. Since the project is intended for kids only the whole tones - white keys are functional. 
The application is not responsible due to the performance that is intended for the keyboard usage, providing the natural stimulation od piano playing. The design is simple, without the unnecessary elements because of the kidsâ€™ concentration abilities.
